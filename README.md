#Description

A simple 2D block catching game, using MySQL to store a high score table like in arcade games.  The falling blocks will represent web dev technologies and score will increase based on how many are caught using the moving platform at the bottom.

#Technologies

* The game will be rendered using Phaser3 
* Player records/high scores will be stored in a MySQL database
* The backend will be a Node.js and Express server
