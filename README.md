#Description

We plan to make a simple 2D game, using MySQL to store a high score table like in arcade games.  Right now we're considering a road crossing game, similar to Frogger.

#Technologies

* The game will be rendered using Phaser3 
* Player records/high scores will be stored in a MySQL database
* The backend will be a Node.js and Express server
